#### Using Julia on the new HPC #### 
From the terminal enter
    module load julia/1.6.4
Now you should be able to enter 
    julia
and obtain the usual julia interface in the terminal

Now, install all the libraries you need
    Pkg.status()
    Pkg.add("StatsBase")
You can check whether this worked with 
    using StatsBase 
and see whether it gives an error

##### Folders & Overall Structure #####
Nothing changes, you can just copy what you had in the previous cluster here (note: I could have files/directories with different names than yours). 
My setting is the following:
- the main folder is called "Graphon"
- inside the folder I have:
    a) the julia script called Integrate_Periodic_Potential.jl 
    b) the submission file submission.sh
    c) a file with the parameters called parameters.csv
    d) a directory called trash
    e) a directory called data with subdirectories data1, data2, ..., data32

There will be a slight change to implement (see next step) in the submission file submission.sh

##### Change in submission file ######
I have added the new submission.sh file in this directory.

##### How to submit the job ####
It is exactly the same!

for i in {1..10}
do
qsub -v "index=$i" -e trash -o trash submission.sh
done
