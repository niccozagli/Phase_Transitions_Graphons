#### Using Julia on the new HPC #### 
From the terminal enter
    module load julia/1.6.4
Now you should be able to enter 
    julia
and obtain the usual julia interface in the terminal

Now, install all the libraries you need
    Pkg.status()
    Pkg.add("StatsBase")
You can check whether this worked with 
    using StatsBase 
and see whether it gives an error

##### Folders & Overall Structure #####
Most things are similar to what we had before, but you cannot just copy what you had in the previous cluster here. 
You should be ok by uploading everything that is in this folder. 
Note: My setup could differ from yours in terms of folder/file names. You can find below a description of what I have. 
My setting is the following:
- the main folder is called "Graphon"
- inside the folder I have:
    a) the julia script called Integrate_Periodic_Potential.jl 
    b) the submission file submission.sh
    c) a file with the parameters called parameters.csv
    d) a directory called trash
    e) a directory called data with subdirectories data1, data2, ..., data32

A few things to keep in mind:
##### Change in the jl script ######
Of course, HPC had a Julia version that was different from what we used to use, so I have had to change a few functions to make it work.
This is why you should use the new jl script! 

##### Change in submission file ######
The way we submit jobs on the HPC is somewhat different.
I have added the new submission.sh file in this directory. You can just have a look at it! 

##### How to submit the job ####
It is exactly the same!
    for i in {1..10}
    do
    qsub -v "index=$i" -e trash -o trash submission.sh
    done
